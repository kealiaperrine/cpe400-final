# cpe400-final

- [x] enter total number of nodes, src, dest

- [x] enter failure probablity for each node

- [x] create random int for number of edges

- [x] create random graph for number of nodes and edges

- [x] print graph

- [x] update weights of each edge, based on faultiness of router (pseudo machine learning is my idea)

- [ ] calculate dijkstra path

- [ ] create random int for total possible number of failed nodes

- [x] calculated random threshold for head node(0 to 2 less than total nodes)

- [x] if failure prob for node is greather than threshold, add to failed nodes

- [x] remove failed nodes from graph

- [x] print updated graph

- [ ] check if dijkstra path has any failed nodes

- [ ] if no, done!

- [ ] if yes:

- [ ] try - run an algorithm that is more flexible (doesnt know everything from start), print path \*still have to pick one

- [ ] catch - there is no path, sorry
